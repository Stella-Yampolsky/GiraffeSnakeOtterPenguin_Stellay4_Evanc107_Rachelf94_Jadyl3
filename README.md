## Project Description
GiraffeSnakeOtterPenguin presents BitStrife!! Our web app aims to simulate a New Yorker's life on a year by year basis, taking into account various factors from death rate by age and environmental detriments by neighborhood to statistics like alcoholism in youth... As the user, your goal is to make choices and live the longest life you can, navigating hardships and managing your health.

## Install Guide
**SSH**: In your computer's ```Terminal/Powershell/Command Prompt```, run the command ```$ git clone git@github.com:Stella-Yampolsky/GiraffeSnakeOtterPenguin_Stellay4_Evanc107_Rachelf94_Jadyl3.git``` in the directory you want this file to be in.

## Launch Codes
**For Spinning BitStrife Up on Local Host**  

1. **Making a Virtual Environment** (skip to Step 2 if a virtual environment with the required modules is already made and can be used)  
  a. In ```Terminal/Powershell/Command Prompt```, run ```$ python3 -m venv [name]``` or ```$ py -m venv [name]``` on Windows.  
  b. Then after the virtual environment is made, activate it with ```$ . [name]/bin/activate``` or ```$ . [name]/Scripts/activate``` on Windows. The virtual environment has been activated if you can see the name of it within parentheses at the beginning of the command line.  
  c. Install the Flask module by navigating to this project's directory and running ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```.
  d. Deactivate the virtual environment with ```$ deactivate```.
3. **Running the Web App on Local Host**  
  a. Activate the virtual environment.  
  b. Enter the app folder with ```$ cd app``` while in this project's directory.
